Churn is vital due to its role in revenue calculations as well as knowing the metrics that a company's data is providing. If we had a churn percentage that was low it would raise the question \"why are customers not staying\". This would lead to more investigation into data as a result. We would want to know what the average monthly charge is and take a dive into the role demographics may be playing."
