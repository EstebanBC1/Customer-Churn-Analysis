# Customer-Churn-Analysis
The aim for this Repository is to compile various mini-projects that are able to portray the learning progress from start to finish of someone expanding their knowledge of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. 

Our projet will be broken up into very small mini projects consiting of the following topics: 
1. Business Problem & Data Intro
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Cleaning
4. Splitting a Dataset
5. Model Selection
6. Evaulation Metrics
7. Feature Importance
8. Communication & Publishing

# Descriptions
Each of these mini project will be conducted inside of a Jupyeter Notebook. Each notboook aims to provide code to accomplish the mini projects goals and also showcase the logic through as much non technical language possible. I would like to show the thought process behind my approaches and document my learning along the way. 

# Goals
I hope to with this format of documenting learn more regarding data analytics and build upon my foundation in Computer Science degree. With learning comes many pitfalls which I also hope to document to be able to look back and view my mistakes.
