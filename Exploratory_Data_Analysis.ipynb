This function also allows for normalization. What this means is that we scale the numbers being on a 1% - 100% point scale rather then just comparing raw values which can be misleading when working with large datasets. Instead we allow for a proportion to take place. In this way we can see that out of all the month-to-month contract types 57% did not churn and 43% churned."
