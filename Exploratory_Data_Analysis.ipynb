This function also allows for normalization. What this means is that we scale the numbers being on a 1% - 100% point scale rather then just comparing raw values which can be misleading when working with large datasets. Instead we allow for a proportion to take place. In this way we can see that out of all the month-to-month contract types 57% did not churn and 43% churned."

    "From the graph, we can see that the median monthly charge for churned customers is between $70 and $80. Customers who churned and fall between the 25th and 50th percentile were generally paying above $80, while those between the 75th and 50th percentile were paying between $55 and $80.\n",
