    "A great way to determing what type of data that we are working with is by using the \".describe()\" method which gives us valuable insights toward the data we are working with. When we ran this command we are able to see various metrics that are being completed. One metric that immediatley speaks out to me is the max metric which depicts 72. This allows me to make the inference that tenure is most likely tracking months not days. However, it is imporant to note that while it is most likely months we should always attempt to ask the source as to what this data is measuring instead of guessing. The \".describe()\" method is used to gather insight, not give you a for sure answer. "
